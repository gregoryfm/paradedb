## Important Notice

`pg_analytics` has been superseded by `pg_lakehouse`. You can read the motivation behind this decision [here](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_lakehouse#motivation). The original project was moved to a [separate repository](https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics).

Once write support has been added to `pg_lakehouse`, both projects will be officially combined.
